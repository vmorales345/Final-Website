    <h1>Undying Love</h1>
    <h2>Victoria Morales</h2>
    <p>I once knew love that wouldn't die, it lived it loved but lived a lie. To leave this love I had to try,I lied to love I know not why.
       I tried to love I tried to leave, the lie i told did she believe to she an angel from above, I told a lie, she gave her love.
      My own love grew to my surprise, blooming so amidst my lies, it flourinshed so I thought best to keep truth closer to the vest.
      This hidden truth you may have guessed, did wrap itself around my chest, my heart it grew the truth grew tight, my conscinece cost me sleep at night.
      Just when I started to relax, I woke to venomous attacks, the dancing truth it laughed with glee, her hateful rage poured over me.
      My flaccid words tried to explain, I never meant to cause her pain, imploring her with tears I cried, that only for her love I lied.
      She left with all her love she gave, I mourned the love I could not save, this ghoul of love yet lives in death, it grips my heart it chokes my breath.
      Undying love beget from sin, lies rotting, putrid deep within, I lied to love deserve do I, to bear the love that will not die?
